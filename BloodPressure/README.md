# Charting

## Usage

- Run the console application (`BloodPressureChartingConsole`) and provide a filename with valid csv format.
- See the script `run.sh` for usage example.
- The script will open a browser window with the generated chart.

## Testing

- I am abusing unit tests to run the program and generate the plot.
- Run the test. It will generate a plot and open it in your default browser.
